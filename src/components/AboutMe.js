                <p>
                    My journey as a full stack developer started when I was studying accountancy in my fourth year, 
                    but I realized that I was not fully passionate about it and I decided to quit. Then I asked myself, 
                    "What's next?" and that's when programming first appeared in my life. My father, who is a 
                    programmer too, recommended me to learn programming and see if I liked it. I started at freeCodeCamp
                    and that was the beginning of something else. I rapidly fell in love and wanted to learn more and
                    more every day about this awesome world of programming and web development. After several months of hard
                    work I learned all the tools that I needed to develop my projects listed down here and I still learning
                    new things to get better. Moving aside from my story of how I started at programming, I like to train, 
                    play tennis, read academic papers related to investing, and yes, you guessed it, mountains!
